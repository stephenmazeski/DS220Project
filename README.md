# DS220Project
Repository for DS220 Project

This Project's purpose is to demonstrate the power of the marriage between PSQL and Python. The data was taken from kaggle and is 2010 World Census Data. The queries are basic however many are created to show the time increase as each additionally query is asked. We then use PostgreSQL to demonstrate the speed at which it can carry out transactions. This is done by taking the same queries as a test constant and taking them all to the power of n=30. A number high enough where the server may be tested yet low enough so that the values may still be stored in memory.

MUST HAVES IN ORDER TO RUN THIS:::

PYTHON 3 (Any newest version)

PSQL SHELL VERSION (I Have hardcoded my generic username, password, and localhost which may need to be changed for others)

PIP INSTALL (Just do all of it for future programs)

Group is up-to-par with using Github. Tests were done in Tests.py in order to approach using data in notebook format using Jupyter Notebook. SM

Decision has been made to stick with Postgres. It is something Stephen is very familiar with and it was talked about in class. SM

1 November 2018

Data has been completely scraped clean for use in PSQL-esque database. This was done using various notepads, along with Google Docs/Sheets. SM

9 November 2018

PSQL Database is running in Beta Phase. This is necessary to ensure all data-types are correct and pyscopg2 recognizes the database rather than the code being treated as "dead" or throwing errors. This can be found in PSQL_Database however will be updated as beta phase is continued into final project. SM


19 November 2018

Postgres Database is fully operational and out of beta phase. Can be found in PSQL_Database.py. SM

20 November 2018

README has been updated (Completely forgot) with progress. Statistical portion of project begins now. SM

24 November 2018

Many queries added and previous warning from CMD fixed. Code now running on personal postgres server and command prompt. SM
